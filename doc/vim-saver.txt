INTRODUCTION                                           *vim-saver-introduction*

VimSaver isn't your everyday auto-save plugin. It's the chill buddy that
casually ensures your work is saved. Imagine writing your magnum opus in Vim,
getting lost in the flow, and never having to worry about the mundane task of
hitting `:w`. That's VimSaver for you!

USAGE                                                        *vim-saver-usage*

With VimSaver, there's minimal setup. Just install it and let it work its magic.
However, you can always take control when you feel like it:

- Toggle VimSaver on/off with the `:SaverToggle` command.

CONFIGURATION                                         *vim-saver-configuration*

While VimSaver is low-key, you can still customize it to vibe with your flow:

- *active* (default: true): 
  Whether VimSaver is on the lookout from the get-go. Set to `false` if you
  want a calm start.

- *debounce_ms* (default: 2584): 
  How patient is VimSaver? This is the delay (in ms) before it saves after 
  detecting changes. Adjust as you see fit.

Example setup in Lua:
>
    require("vim-saver").setup({
        active = true,
        debounce_ms = 3000,
    })

COMMANDS                                                   *vim-saver-commands*

- `:SaverToggle`: 
  Takes the wheel or hands it back to you. Toggle VimSaver on/off with this.

TROUBLESHOOTING                                     *vim-saver-troubleshooting*
